# AlphaGoConnect4_V2
Version 2 of alpha go connect 4 version 2


Hey joe,

All the games we want to work with this will inherit from the 
AbstractGameState abstract class. Just implement those methods for a game.

DummyGameState is an example but i just refactored it so it may not be 100% correct.

also we need to make custom NNs for each game. TestGameNN has an example. TestGameNN is not complete
